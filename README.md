# Welcome to the github of the first official website of Alex Bradshaw.
## Access the website [here!](https://alexbradshaw5.github.io/)
This is the second iteration of my personal/portfolio page, which I've independently created by teaching myself HTML and CSS. While there are limitless possibilities in website presentation, I'm no software engineer. However, I am proud that I've successfully and sufficiently developed an effective webpage. The goal of the website and this GitHub repository is to showcase not only my capabilities and skills as a data scientist but also my ability to conquer any endeavor of my choosing such as learning web development.
